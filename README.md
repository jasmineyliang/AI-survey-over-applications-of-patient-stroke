1. Introduction
The late 1980s and early 1990s [1] culminated in advances in technology that radically transformed the promise of minimally invasive surgery within medical subspecialties, particularly neuro- surgery, that we see today. Subsequent advances in artificial intel- ligence have the potential to dramatically accelerate the efficiency of robotic technologies, improving the potential applications. Although the use of robotics in medicine is relatively novel, advances within the realm of robotic medicine have allowed for its adoption by numerous surgical specialties and physicians [2] worldwide. Since its initial use in 1985 for neurosurgical biopsies [3], robotic medicine has demonstrated great promise that can be attributed to its potential for superior visualization of the operative field, the capability to enact motion scaling [4], improved move- ment precision during surgical procedures, inherent resistance

abstract
In the last forty years, the field of medicine has experienced dramatic shifts in technology-enhanced sur- gical procedures – from its initial use in 1985 for neurosurgical biopsies to current implementation of systems such as magnetic-guided catheters for endovascular procedures. Systems such as the Niobe Magnetic Navigation system and CorPath GRX have allowed for utilization of a fully integrated surgical robotic systems for perioperative manipulation, as well as tele-controlled manipulation systems for tele- medicine. These robotic systems hold tremendous potential for future implementation in cerebrovascular procedures, but lack of relevant clinical experience and uncharted ethical and legal territory for real-life tele-robotics have stalled their adoption for neurovascular surgery, and might present significant chal- lenges for future development and widespread implementation. Yet, the promise that these technologies hold for dramatically improving the quality and accessibility of cerebrovascular procedures such as thrombectomy for acute stroke, drives the research and development of surgical robotics. These tech- nologies, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities such as machine learning, deep-learning, and outcome-based analyses and modifications, have the capability to uncover new dimensions within the realm of cerebrovascular surgery.
